## Development Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Release Notes
This release represents the successful completion of the original objective: extracting reusable components from existing MCP servers (Social MCP Server and AI-based CI/CD MCP Server) to create a universal framework that accelerates future MCP development.

The framework has been thoroughly tested and validated, with all core components working correctly:
- Service-oriented architecture patterns
- Natural language processing utilities
- TypeScript server generation
- Authentication and configuration management
- Professional error handling

The framework is ready for production use and will significantly accelerate MCP server development across different domains.
